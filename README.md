# LearningFlaskAPI

This repository is dedicated to my personal learning journey in building RESTful APIs using Python Flask, specifically for desktop applications. It includes experiments with creating APIs, handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and integrating them with desktop applications using JSON and authentication techniques.

## Features
- Development of RESTful APIs using Flask
- Handling HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- JSON data exchange and serialization
- Authentication and security practices
- Integration with desktop applications
